Hey this is Shankar Shakya
I am very happy to share you that I have made new project by own. I have used some python libraries to
make this project which controls the action of mouse by hand gestures and give us feeling of virtual mouse. I was energetic and
motivated during this project.

Python libraries used:
1. Mediapipe  :- for hand detection,hand landmarks detection etc.
2.time :- for knowing frame per second
3.PyAutoGUI:- for making the hotkeys by hand gesture to control the  mouse
4. OpenCv :- for videocapture and much more
5. numpy:-  for converting our range into actual screen resolution
